									<p>During my two-week work experience at Garrett Advancing Motion (formerly known as Honeywell) in France, I had the opportunity to shadow the dual turbo design team and gain valuable exposure to various team members. This experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding of turbocharger design and its intricate components.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Garrett.jpg" alt="" /></span>Throughout the program, I followed a structured schedule that allowed me to learn from skilled professionals, who shared the theory behind turbos and provided in-depth explanations of each component. I gained insights into the different stages of a turbocharger, including the compressor and turbine, and was fortunate to witness the entire manufacturing process, from start to finish, including quality control steps.</p>
									<p>Collaborating closely with the dual turbo team, I actively participated in the review of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using CATIA software. I contributed my opinions and insights to support the final design by identifying potential design flaws that caused air particles to backflow and collide with other fast-moving ones. I discovered that such flaws result in a loss of compressor speed and reduced airflow to the cylinders, significantly impacting performance.</p>
									<p>During this internship, my primary responsibility involved collecting data from over 30 simulations and analysing the turbocharger prototype using computer simulations. I meticulously interpreted the data and presented my findings to the team, which influenced further advancements in the final design. This experience sharpened my data analytical skills as I synthesised complex information and contributed to the decision-making process.</p>
									<p>Overall, my internship at Garrett Advancing Motion was highly insightful, providing me with the opportunity to engage with industry professionals, deepen my knowledge of turbocharger design, and develop crucial data analytical skills.</p>
