										<h1>Exam Qualified Chartered Accountant</h1>
									</header>
									<p>At Dixon Wilson I have built the foundations of my accounting career, transitioning from academic theory to the practical, fast-paced world of a leading London firm. I joined as a graduate and progressed into a position of a Exam Qualified Chartered Accountant, working on multiple clients and tackling complex technical work. It is a environment that valued precision and client service, and where I learn to apply my analytical mindset to the diverse challenges of modern accountancy.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/dw.jpeg" alt="" /></span>My work centred on delivering core compliance and advisory services to a wide range of clients, from private individuals and complex trusts to UK subsidiaries of international groups and owner-managed businesses. A significant part of my role involved the end-to-end preparation of statutory financial statements under UK GAAP, primarily FRS 102 and FRS 105. I took ownership of the process from the initial client bookkeeping review through to the final submission, ensuring every figure was accurate and every disclosure was correct. This included handling the corporation tax computations for these entities, giving me a rounded view of their financial obligations.</p>
									<p>I was particularly drawn to more intricate assignments, such as managing the year-end accounts for a large estate with assets exceeding £111 million. This involved detailed work on fixed asset registers and capital allowance schedules, requiring close collaboration with the audit team. I also gained valuable experience with international standards, managing the quarterly and annual reporting for several IFRS entities, which sharpened my understanding of more complex consolidation and disclosure requirements.</p>
									<p>A key area of responsibility and growth was in trust and estate administration. I managed the financial affairs for a substantial portfolio of over 20 trusts across two distinct groups. This role was far more than compliance; it involved understanding the unique circumstances of each trust, preparing their accounts, calculating distributable income, and completing the nuanced tax returns.</p>
									<p>Beyond client work, I embraced opportunities for technical leadership. I was entrusted with supervising the day-to-day work of junior trainees, reviewing their accounts and tax return preparations, and providing guidance to help them develop their skills. The most significant technical challenge I led was a major CRS (Common Reporting Standard) compliance project. I was responsible for researching the regulatory requirements, designing and building the XML reporting framework for a client with over 1,000 reportable persons, and overseeing the successful submission. This project taught me how to manage a large-scale, data-intensive compliance process from initial research to final implementation.</p>
									<p>My experience at Dixon Wilson is defined by a commitment to technical excellence, client service, and collaborative problem-solving. It equipped me with the rigorous skills and practical knowledge needed to manage complex workflows, advise clients with confidence, and contribute meaningfully to a senior team.</p>
