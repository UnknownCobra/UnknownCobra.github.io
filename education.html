										<h1>Education</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I have achieved a strong educational foundation that has laid the stepping stones for my current and future pursuits. My GCSE results reflect my dedication and commitment, showcasing my proficiency across various subjects: Mathematics (A), Physics (A*), English (B), Electronics (A), Chemistry (A), Biology (B), Geography (B), and Religious Studies (A).</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/education.jpg" alt="" /></span>With a clear aspiration to delve into the realm of engineering, I pursued A-Levels in Mathematics, Physics, and Economics. This combination not only aligned with my passion for engineering but also allowed me to nurture my analytical skills and delve into economic principles. The outcome of my A-Level journey was marked by commendable grades of BBB in Mathematics, Physics, and Economics.</p>
									<p>Building upon this solid academic foundation, I ventured into higher education at Loughborough University, where I dedicated myself to the rigorous discipline of Aeronautical Engineering. This phase culminated in the attainment of a distinguished Master's degree with a 2:1 classification, a testament to my dedication and rigorous work ethic. The comprehensive education I received during this period not only enriched my understanding of engineering intricacies but also fostered critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective collaboration within a dynamic academic environment.</p>
									<p>Currently, I am an Exam Qualified Chartered Accountant having successfully completed all 15 ACA examinations on the first attempt. This achievement reflects not only a strong grasp of technical accounting principles, auditing, tax, and business strategy, but also a disciplined approach to rigorous study and consistent performance under pressure. I have applied this structured, mastery-based mindset directly to my practical work, ensuring that the theoretical foundation provided by the ACA enhances the precision, compliance, and quality of the financial reporting and advisory services I deliver.</p>
									<p>Each phase of my education has been a stepping stone, equipping me with the skills, knowledge, and resilience to excel in the multifaceted landscape of engineering and finance.</p>
